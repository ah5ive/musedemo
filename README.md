# Muse demo

Creating a app for musician to upload their demos to their own site and having a play list to play their music.

### The problem

often when artist are offer to present their demos and they have to complie it and send the mp3 thru an email.

### The solution

Having a plalist for record companies to listen sort the problem. It had a profile page of the writer and a ever updating list of song for the A & R to choose.

Creating a user login. A user page with uploading functionality and a database for keeping a record of the uploading files. The files will be upload to a storage space.
